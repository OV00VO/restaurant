    * **Testing:** (If applicable) During the reservation process, look for an option to split the bill. Select the split bill option and specify the number of guests in the party. Submit the reservation and verify if the restaurant receives the reservation details with the split bill request.
    * **Result:** Pass (if split bill option is processed and transmitted) / Fail (if split bill option is unavailable or not sent to the restaurant)

* **Test Case 58: Reservation Notes (Pass/Fail)**
    * **Expected Result:** Users can add internal notes to reservations (for staff use only). Verify the system stores these notes securely and allows authorized staff to access them.
    * **Testing:** (If applicable) During the reservation process, look for a designated field for internal notes (likely not visible to users). Simulate adding an internal note for staff (e.g., dietary restrictions).  Log in with a designated staff account and verify if the internal note is visible and accessible.
    * **Result:** Pass (if notes are stored securely and accessible to authorized staff) / Fail (if notes are not secure, accessible to unauthorized users, or not displayed for staff)

**Advanced User Management:**

#### Test Cases

* **Test Case 59: User Account Deletion (Pass/Fail)**
    * **Expected Result:** Logged-in users can delete their accounts. Verify the system prompts for confirmation, deletes the account securely, and removes all associated reservation data.
    * **Testing:** Log in to a user account. Locate the option to delete the account and initiate the deletion process. Verify the system prompts for confirmation and requires entering the password for verification. After confirmation, verify if the account is deleted and reservation history is no longer accessible.
    * **Result:** Pass (if account deletion is secure, confirmed, and removes all data) / Fail (if deletion is easy without confirmation, doesn't remove data, or encounters errors)

* **Test Case 60: Multiple Account Logins (Pass/Fail)**
    * **Expected Result:** Test if users can log in to their accounts from multiple devices simultaneously (if applicable). Verify the system handles this scenario securely and avoids conflicts.
    * **Testing:** (If applicable) Log in to a user account on one device. Then, on a separate device, attempt to log in to the same account. Verify the system either allows login on both devices (with clear warnings) or prompts the user to log out from the first device for security reasons. 
    * **Result:** Pass (if system handles multiple logins securely or prevents conflicts) / Fail (if multiple logins are unrestricted or cause data inconsistencies)
